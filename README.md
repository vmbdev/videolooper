# Video Looper Extension for Chromium-based browsers
Video Looper allows you to set whether a website should loop all of its videos automatically, or if you want to disable any kind of looping.

## Installation
For the moment, go to the [extensions settings](chrome://extension), press **Load unpacked** and select the folder where the code is.
In the future I may add it to the Chrome Web Store, if somehow I can bypass the permission restrictions (it requires access to \<all_urls\>).

## Usage
Click on the extension button and add any pattern you want like *https://google.com/*. You can also add wildcards (\*), i.e. *https://\*.nytimes.com/\**. Important to finish the pattern with / or /\* (https://google.com/ instead of https://google.com).
