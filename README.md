# Video Looper Extension for Chromium-based browsers

Video Looper allows you to set whether a website should loop all of its videos
automatically, or if you want to disable any kind of looping.

## Installation

For the moment, go to the [extensions settings](chrome://extension), press
**Load unpacked** and select the folder where the code is. In the future I may
add it to the Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Opera extension stores.

## Usage

Click on the extension button and add any pattern you want like
*`https://google.com/`*. You can also add wildcards (\*), i.e.
*`https://\*.nytimes.com/\*`*. Important to finish the pattern with /\* for the
subpaths (`https://google.com/`* instead of `https://google.com`).
